EU air passenger rights apply:

    If your flight is within the EU and is operated either by an EU or a non-EU airline
    If your flight arrives in the EU from outside the EU and is operated by an EU airline
    If your flight departs from the EU to a non-EU country operated by an EU or a non-EU airline
    If you have not already received benefits (compensation, re-routing, assistance from the airline) for flight related problems for this journey under the relevant law of a non-EU country.


EU means the 27 EU countries, including Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, RÃ©union Island, Mayotte, Saint-Martin (French Antilles), the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands (but not the Faeroe Islands). EU rules also apply to flights to and from Iceland , Norway and Switzerland.

The outbound and return flights are always considered as two separate flights even if they were booked as part of one reservation. In some cases the airline operating the flight (also known as the operating air carrier) may not be the same as the one from which you bought your ticket. In case of any difficulties only the airline which operates the flight can be held responsible. In cases where an airline hires (under a wet lease) an aircraft including crew from another airline, the airline which hires the aircraft has operational responsibility for the flight and is regarded as the operating airline under EU rules (specifically Regulation 261/2004).

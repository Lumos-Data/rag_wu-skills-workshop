Reimbursement, re-routing or rebooking in the event of denied boarding

The airline must offer you, on a oneoff basis, a choice between:

    the reimbursement of your ticket and, if you have a connecting flight, a return flight to the airport of departure at the earliest opportunity
    re-routing to your final destination at the earliest opportunity or,
    re-routing at a later date at your convenience under comparable transport conditions (i.e. ‘rebooking'), subject to the availability of seats.

As soon as you have chosen one of these three options, you no longer have rights in relation to the other two options. However, the airline may still have to provide compensation depending on the distance of your flight and the length of the delay past your original planned arrival time.

    If the airline does not comply with its obligation to offer re-routing or return under comparable transport conditions at the earliest opportunity, it has to reimburse your flight costs.
    If the airline does not offer you the choice between reimbursement and re-routing but decides unilaterally to reimburse your original ticket, you are entitled to an additional reimbursement of the price difference with the new ticket (under comparable transport conditions).
    If you booked an outbound and a return flight separately with different airlines and the outbound flight is cancelled, reimbursement is only due for the cancelled flight.

However, if the outbound and return flights are operated by different airlines, but were part of a single reservation, in the event that the outbound flight was cancelled, you have the following rights:

    Compensation
    A choice between the reimbursement of your entire ticket (outbound and return flights) or re-routing on another flight for the outbound flight

Unless the terms and conditions of your ticket specify otherwise, you are not entitled to reimbursement or re‑rerouting if:

    you were denied boarding on reasonable health, safety or security grounds

    you did not have the required travel documents

Assistance in the event of denied boarding

Airlines should provide assistance free of charge while you wait. In the event of travel disruption, you should make yourself known to the airline, to avoid a situation where you have to make your own arrangements. Airlines should also ensure, where available, that accommodation is accessible for people with disabilities and their service dogs. The assistance to be provided includes:

    Refreshments
    Food
    Accommodation (if you are rebooked to travel the next day)
    Transport to your accommodation and return to the airport
    2 telephone calls, telex, fax messages or emails

If assistance is not offered and you paid for any of the above items out of your own pocket, the airline should reimburse you, provided the expenses were necessary, reasonable and appropriate. You should keep all receipts for this purpose. You only have the right to assistance as long as you have to wait for re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to your final destination at the earliest opportunity or a return flight.

In exceptional cases, the airline may decide to limit or decline assistance if it would cause further delay to passengers waiting for an alternative or a delayed flight.

Unless the terms and conditions of your ticket specify otherwise, you are not entitled to assistance if:

    you were denied boarding on reasonable health, safety or security grounds
    you did not have the required travel documents

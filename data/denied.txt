Denied boarding

You may be denied boarding by the airline:

    For safety, security or health reasons (for example if you did not inform the airline in advance of any severe infectious diseases or allergies) or if you don't have the correct travel documents (more information on documents you need for travel in Europe)
    If you didn't take the outbound flight of a reservation which included a return flight
    If you didn't take the other flight(s) included in a reservation with consecutive flights
    If you don't have the relevant documentation for your pet when it is travelling with you

If you have presented yourself on time for check-in with a valid flight reservation and travel documentation and you're denied boarding by the airline due to overbooking or for operational reasons, and you don't voluntarily give up your seat, you are entitled to:

    compensation
    the right to choose between reimbursement, re-routing or rebooking at a later stage and
    assistance

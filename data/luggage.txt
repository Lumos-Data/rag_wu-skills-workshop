Lost, damaged or delayed luggage
Checked-in luggage

If your checked-in luggage is lost, damaged or delayed, the airline is liable and you're entitled to compensation up to an amount of approximately EUR 1 300. However if the damage was caused by an inherent defect in the baggage itself, you're not entitled to any compensation.
Hand luggage

If your hand luggage is damaged the airline is liable if it was responsible for the damage.
Travel insurance

To ensure you have sufficient coverage when travelling with expensive items it's advisable to take out private insurance. If you do not wish to do so you can for a fee request a higher compensation limit (in excess of EUR 1 300) from the airline you are travelling with. This must be done in advance and at the latest when you check-in.
How to complain

If you want to file a claim for lost or damaged luggage, you should do it in writing to the airline within 7 days, or within 21 days of receiving your luggage if it was delayed. There is no standard EU-wide form.

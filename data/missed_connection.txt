You missed your connecting flight

Connecting flights are journeys where you have to take more than one flight to get to your final destination.

If you miss a connecting flight, and arrive at your final destination with a delay of more than 3 hours, you are entitled to compensation. This compensation is calculated according to the length of the delay and the distance to your final destination.

You have a right to compensation if:

    your flights were booked as part of a single reservation and
    EU air passenger rights apply and
    the delay to your arrival time was not caused by extraordinary circumstances



You are not entitled to compensation if you miss your connecting flight due to delays at security checks or if you did not respect the boarding time of your flight at the airport of transfer.
